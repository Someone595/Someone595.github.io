              So if the United States faked the moon landings, then who benefited from it? Many countries in fact, one of them being New Zealand. New Zealand is a country with a population of 4.7 million, and a GDP of 208 billion (USD). But most importantly, it is an allie of the US, the ANZUS. The ANZUS was developed in 1951 in fear of any threat of an Japanese attack on New Zealand. Due to this, New Zealand had to join the US in Vietnam, despite the public backlash. As the US exceeded in the moon landings, New Zealand became more powerful.

              After Sputnik was launched, and started the space race, the Americans needed to show the world that they were superior. In less than three months, Explorer 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The man behind it all was William Pickering. A leading New Zealand scientist. Years later became a prominent figure in the space race, leading NASA into victory.

              After the moon landings New Zealand became stronger allies to the US, which meant that their trade agreements, economy prospered, as well as their relationships. This was proven in 1963 to 1975, when New Zealand troops landed in the Vietnam War, alongside the US.

              As the US eventually won over the USSR in the space war and the war of capitalism vs communism, the world knew it’s answer. Capitalism is a superior way, this promoted New Zealand to follow the US. New Zealand is still a very capitalist country, following many of the US policies as well.

              Not only did New Zealand benefit from the moon landings in 1969, they are still benefiting from it today. In 2016, a New Zealand based space agency emerged, The New Zealand Space Agency. And guess who’s backing it up? That’s right, NASA! The NZSA invited high-performing students to participate in NASA’s international internship program. “This agreement represents one giant leap in our extensive scientific cooperation” - US Ambassador Scott Brown
