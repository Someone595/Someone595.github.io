              After the cold war, in 1957, Russia and the United States of America, started the Space Race. ‘The Space Race’ was a giant competition between the USA and the USSR to space. Since both countries wanted domination over the other in technology and in space, they both rushed productions of rockets, kicking of the Space Race. Both countries wanted a man in space before the other, which was “won” by the Russians. Due to this major loss, the United States challenged the Russians to the moon. The Space Race was of critical importance for both nations, as they wanted to prove to the world that they had the best scientists and the best economy to support its projects.

              In 1957, the Russians supposedly launched the “Sputnik”, which was an artificial satellite. The Sputnik transmitted radio signals to radio stations. The Sputnik died after 3 weeks of its launch, due to its batteries dying. The Sputnik terrified the Americans, as it supposedly orbited the earth about 98 minutes and it remained a constant reminder for the Americans of Russian supporitiy. The Russains “won” again in 1958, where they supposedly launched the “Sputnik ll”, with a dog in it. Yet again the russians “won”, on 1961 April 12th, with the first cosmonaut (a cosmonaut is a russian astronaut) in space and to orbit the earth, Yuri Gagarin. If you haven’t been keeping track, its 3 - 0.

              The US felt embarrassed for losing to the Russians, so they challenged them to the moon in 1961. This was the ultimate test for them, as if they failed, they would lose to the Russians. Losing their title of Global Super Power. The US became a superpower after WW2, being the only country with a strong economy and military shape. The Space Race pitted the opposite ideologies capitalism (through US) and communism (through USSR). In May of 1961, John F Kenndy challenged the Russians to the moon.

              “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.” - John F Kennedy, May 1961

              Due to this in 1961 to 1964, NASA’s (or National Aeronautics and Space Administration) budget was almost increased by 500%. The American’s caught up in 1961, just 3 weeks after John F Kenndy’s challenge, by sending the first american in space, Alan Shepard. Again in 1961 John Glenn, apparently orbited the earth. In January 1967, unfortunately 3 astronauts died after their spacecraft caught on fire. Its estimated that 100,000 to 200,000 people worked at NASA from 1962 to 1968. It was also estimated that there were 10 americans to 1 russian.

              This happened quite a bit, think of a very boring tennis match, and the tennis ball being a symbol of nationalism. Both countries were very patoric, and wanted victory over the other. Where one would launch the first man into space, and the other to challenge them to the moon. This is why the moon landing was so important. The Americans knew they needed to overcome the Russians, so they had to develop the plot of “going” to the moon. The only motivation was their nationalism. They wanted their country to win, soo badly that they could flow piles of money just to make a fake scene and buy expensive cameras just to fake the moon landing. It was all about nationalism, they wanted to show the Russians and the rest of the world that they had the best economy and the best infrastructure for its projects.

              After WW2, the world tried to look at democracy than war, It came up with two ideologies, capitalism and communism. Thee world needed a way to advance and have a sustainable economy to support their projects and infrastructure. The US favoured capitalism, and the USSR communism, and the world watched to see who was stronger. Both global superpowers pitted against each other in the cold war, it was the ultimate war, capitalism vs communism. In December of 1968, Apollo 8 was launched, and became the first manned spacecraft to orbit the moon. On July 16, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Micheal Collins set off in the Apollo 11 space mission. After landing on July 20th, Neil Armstrong said the famous quote “One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind”. By landing on the moon, the US “won” the space race. Between 1969 and 1972, the Russians tried to launched 4 spacecrafts to the moon. But failed. This just sparked more uproar for the capitalistic  US. The astronauts were treated as heroes among their communities. While the Russian’s were looked at as the ultimate villians in the eyes of the US. This was the ultimate win for capitalism against communism.

              So why didn’t the Russians send a man to the moon? Well at the time, Nikita Khrushchev, leader of Soviet Russia, considered ICBs (Intercontinental ballistic missiles) more important. Therefore the soviet russian program received lower funds. But there were a few attempts to launch a man to space. Sergei Pavlovich Korolev, the leader of the soviet space program and the man behind many of the space successes of the soviets. When it came to designing the rockets and spaceships, the soviets had difficulty, due to politics, not enough funding and engines. The soviets refused to use engines that were under-developed, which the US used since they were developing them for 5 years. Instead they choose to use engines that they used in launches of Sputnik 1 and 2. This came at a price however, due to the rocket weighing 9 tonnes, they needed a lot of rockets. 30 to be precise. 24 in a circle and 6 in the middle. But as you add more engines, there is a more likely chance of rockets failing. Due to the size and the weight of the rocket, it had to be disassembled and reassembled at the launch site. Further increasing the chances of a failure. On 21st of February 1969, the N1 was ready to be launched. When the rocket launched, the 2 out of the 30 rockets failed immediately, which ruptured fuel lines, due to the buildup of pressure. Which burned up inside the rocket, destroying it’s control panel. This caused all of the engines to shutdown, and the rocket crashed. The second rocket also failed due to the engines shutting down, and it fell back to its launch site, explosion. The explosion caused 2 year delay.  By then the Americans landed on the moon.

              We have a lot to thank the space race, the International Space Station, International Ballistic missiles, Satellites, GPS, and many many more things. The global positioning system (GPS), was developed for military weapons and navigation, now it is used everywhere, from your smartphone to your car. Satellites were useful for communications from space to earth and vice versa, but they were adapted so they could send video feed, and that is why we have satellites and satellite TV’s. The significance of the space race was massive, for the time and the future, thanks to it we have many technologies that make our lives more comfortable.
